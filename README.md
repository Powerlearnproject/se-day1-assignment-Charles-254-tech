# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is a discipline that involves designing, developing, testing, testing, and maintaining software applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Fortran.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: it involves collecting and documenting the system requirements
Design: creating a comprehensive design of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation: coding and building the software per the design specifications
Testing: carrying out tests to ensure that the software is functional and of the required quality
Deployment: releasing the software to users
Maintenance: continuous support and upgrades of the software that follow after its deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall assigns team members to projects in a disciplined manner, giving each member a clear set of tasks and responsibilities while the agile approach encourages team members to work together on various project components across time in a more self-organizing team structure.
Planning in a waterfall process is a sequential process that starts at the start of the project and involves outlining all needs and goals in great detail. Agile planning, on the other hand, is a continuous process carried out during the project, with modifications made when new requirements or information become available.
The waterfall method is suitable for long-term projects while the agile method uses brief iterations to produce value quickly, enabling teams to make changes to their plans over time and complete tasks in less time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
writing codes and implementing software solutions (software developer)
Ensuring software designed is of the best quality (a quality assurance engineer)
overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of the software projects (a project manager)

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
